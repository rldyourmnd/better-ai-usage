# Windows (Placeholder)

Status: not implemented yet.

## Target Plan

Future Windows implementation will include:

- Platform-specific install scripts (PowerShell)
- Terminal baseline and prompt profile parity
- Layered tool mapping equivalent to Linux/macOS where possible
- Health-check and config-parity workflow

## Current State

- No production install scripts for Windows in this repository yet.
- Use Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) or macOS implementation for now.
